<button class="accordion">What is a Coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
  </p>
  </div>
<button class="accordion">What is COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
 </p>
 </div>
<button class="accordion">How does COVID-19 spread?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

<button class="accordion">Who should get tested for novel coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> Even if you have a fever and a severe cough, or a sore throat, you still need not get tested as of now unless you fit in two criteria. The first criteria are whether you have travelled abroad in the last 14 days, especially to a country where an outbreak of novel coronavirus is happening or you have come in close contact with a laboratory-confirmed case of Covid-19.
  </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long does it take for symptoms to appear?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This is what we call the incubation period. It usually takes between 2-7 days but it varies up to 14 days. Rarely, it has been reported that sometimes it can take even longer but in most patients, within 5-7 days symptoms will start to appear in the form of fever, cough and sore throat.
  </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should everyone be wearing masks?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Everyone need not wear a mask. It is important to understand that if you have a cough and cold, you should wear a mask so that you don't transmit the infection to others. If you are a healthcare worker looking after patients, it's worthwhile to wear a mask. Otherwise, a common person going out for day-to-day work or is at home or even going out for some time need not wear a mask, it does not protect you. Sometimes it can be harmful because you might end up touching your face to re-adjust the mask and end up transmitting disease from an infected surface on to your face using your hands
  </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should those with asthma wear a mask?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Those with asthma need not necessarily wear masks. However, they need to wash their hands regularly and maintain social distancing apart from avoiding crowded places.
  </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If a colleague gets infected, what should be done?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you have come in contact who is infected, it is important to start the process of self-quarantine because you could get the infection or end up transmitting it.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is it safe to visit hospitals with Covid-19 patients?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p> It's safe to visit hospitals because patients infected with novel coronavirus are being kept in isolation wards. However, one must not visit the hospital at this time unless it is absolutely necessary. Routine healthcare visits should be postponed.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will summer or humidity kill the novel coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>My feeling is that it would not. It might decrease the transmissibility of the virus. We still have cases in tropical countries like Singapore and Thailand. A large number of us spend a lot of time inside the house or shopping malls, areas which are air-conditioned. And here the temperature is low and there is crowding. If one person has the infection and he is coughing, the person can spread the virus.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should malls and restaurants be avoided?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As of now, till we are not sure about the resolution of this pandemic, I would say that we should take to the process of social distancing.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can a person cured of novel coronavirus get it again?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>This is a viral infection unlike swine flu or H1N1 but once you are exposed to the infection, there is a chance of getting it again. Once you get the infection, there are antibodies produced in the body which protect you against subsequent infection or make it less severe. If you get exposed to novel coronavirus, later on, it will be a mild infection.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is social distancing the best way to tackle this disease in a country like India?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The UK is following a similar model where it is allowing the infection to spread to the community but protect the high-risk groups (elderly, diabetic, hypertension, heart or respiratory issues). Since the mortality in the younger age group is very low, you may have a large number of individuals who may get the infection and cause herd immunity and therefore, you might not have a very large outbreak.

However, young people can still transmit the disease to the elderly which is why herd community can create problems in a country like India
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will sipping hot water kill the virus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Neither sipping hot water nor consumption of alcohol will kill the virus. Alcohol-based sanitisers kill the virus on your hands but once in your throat, the virus infects the cells and alcohol cannot help there.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are hand sanitisers better than soap?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you can use soap with water, it is a better thing. One uses soap more thoroughly and it helps clear the virus in between the fingers and under the nails. If you do not have soap, use hand sanitiser but clean your hands thoroughly and regularly.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p> Depends on the surface. Some data suggests that it can survive on cardboard for a few hours or other surfaces which are metal-based and especially if the temperature is low and the humidity is high, it may even survive 6-8 hours. That is why it is important to regularly wash hours.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will a cough droplet that falls on one's clothes infect someone?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you touch the cough droplet on your clothes with your hands and then touch your face, it can lead to infection. Touching one's face should be avoided. The cough droplet cannot reach one's respiratory tract by itself.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What type of masks is preferred?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The N-95 and triple-aid masks are for healthcare workers operating in hospitals and infected areas. The self-made face cover does not have a very strong filter but it helps in reducing the transmission. If everyone covers their face with self-made masks, including people who have a very mild coronavirus infection, the droplets of water will not jump from host to host.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can an asymptomatic person spread the virus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Initial data pointed out that this was unlikely but some data suggests that some percentage of individuals may be having no symptoms but they could still be spreading the disease, especially in the younger age group and that has emerged in the last few weeks.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should senior citizens with mild cough also get tested?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no need for that. However, senior citizens must try and stay at home and wash their hands frequently. Solution is not testing, the solution is preventing not getting the infection.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long does it take to recover from Covid-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>It depends on what type of illness you have. According to the breakup that we have, 80 per cent of individuals will have a mild or asymptomatic disease and they will recover on their own within 5-7 days. You have another 15 per cent who have a border disease, may need hospitalisation and they will recover within 10-15 days. The remaining 5 per cent who have a severe disease will be in the ICU, may need ventilator support and they may take about three weeks to recover.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does hydroxychloroquine work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We had initially one study from France. More recently, another study has come up from China which suggests that giving hydroxychloroquine to Covid-19 patients can decrease the viral load, decreasing the days of admission in hospital required. So, there is some evidence although it is limited. We need more data to establish a clear link.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is it safe to buy newspapers?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p> It is safe to buy newspapers because it is not like the person delivering the newspaper is infected because if he was infected, the delivery person would have symptoms and those who are concerned can see how they can clean their newspapers thoroughly. The chance of transmission through newspapers is very little.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can rapid testing help in containing the outbreak?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The rapid test will give us information about how the Covid-19 infection is panning out in different parts of the country. If the rapid test suggests that a lot of people in one region test positive, then one can say that there is still ongoing infection in that region. If you do rapid tests in a region where a lot of people are symptomatic but most of them test negative, it can be said that their symptoms are not related to coronavirus but common flu.
